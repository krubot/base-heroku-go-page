# base-heroku-go-page

This is a very simple go web application for deploying to heroku. Code is full open to be copied and used locally though small changes to vendor.json, .travis.yml and Procfile files need to be made to reflect the new name and path. Additionally, you'll need a heroku account and travis ci integration before deployment.

Feel free to make issues or feature requests on the github board but note it's likely there will be a delayed response from my lack of commitment.
